          <h2>About my journey</h2>
          <p>
            A path shaped by nutrition, diverse industries, and a return to purpose.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="long-form">
          <p>
            My journey began in the field of nutrition, where I formally trained as a
            nutritionist and built a strong foundation in health, wellness, and mindful
            eating. I went on to work closely with hospitals for nearly two years,
            including valuable experience at Manipal Hospital, where I gained hands-on
            exposure to clinical nutrition and patient-centered care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curiosity and a desire to explore diverse professional landscapes then led
            me beyond healthcare. I spent several years in the IT sector, gaining
            insights into structured systems, operations, and problem-solving in a
            fast-paced corporate environment. Along the way, I also worked in the real
            estate sector, which further strengthened my understanding of business
            dynamics, people management, and long-term planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these varied experiences, my passion for nutrition and clean,
            conscious food never faded. Over time, this passion naturally evolved into
            a deep interest in microgreens—nutrient-dense, sustainable, and powerful in
            their impact on everyday health. Today, that passion has come full circle,
            bringing me to where I am now: combining my background in nutrition with my
            love for growing fresh, wholesome food, and sharing it with others in its
            purest form.
          </p>
          <p>
            This journey, shaped by learning, exploration, and purpose, continues to
            guide everything I do.
